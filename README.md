# Smile-Detector
<h1>Real-Time Face Detection and Smile Recognition</h1>
This Python script demonstrates real-time face detection and smile recognition using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library. It utilizes pre-trained Haar cascade classifiers for detecting frontal faces and smiles from live webcam feed.

Features:
Detects frontal faces in real-time using a Haar cascade classifier.
Recognizes smiles within detected faces using another Haar cascade classifier.
Draws rectangles around detected faces and smiles.
Labels smiling faces with "Smiling" text below the face rectangle.
Requirements:
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2) library
Pre-trained Haar cascade classifiers for face and smile detection (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml and haarcascade_smile.xml, respectively)
Usage:
Clone or download the repository.
Ensure that Python and OpenCV are installed on your system.
Run the Python script (face_smile_detection.py).
View the real-time face detection and smile recognition from your webcam feed.
Note:
The Haar cascade classifiers (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml and haarcascade_smile.xml) are included in the repository. However, you may replace them with other classifiers for improved performance or different use cases.
Credits:
This project is inspired by various tutorials and examples on face detection and smile recognition using OpenCV.
